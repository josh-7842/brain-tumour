This project classifies brain MRI images into Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor categories using deep learning.
A custom Convolutional Neural Network was designed and trained on MRI images.
Images were preprocessed using resizing,normalization and data augmentation techniques.
The model was evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices.
Streamlit application lets  users upload MRI images and view predictions with confidence scores.
The custom CNN was selected over transfer learning models due to it's stable and balanced predictions.
